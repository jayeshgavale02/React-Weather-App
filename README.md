# ☀️ React Weather App (Using Vite)

## 🌤️ Overview
This is a **Weather Application** built using **React.js** and **Vite** that fetches real-time weather data from an external API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap). Users can search for any city and get the current weather details, including temperature, humidity, weather conditions, and more.

## ✨ Features
- **Search by City**: Enter a city name to fetch current weather data.
- **Real-Time Weather Data**: Displays up-to-date information fetched from the weather API.
- **Detailed Weather Information**: Provides details like temperature, humidity, weather description, and more.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive, ensuring it looks great on desktop and mobile devices.
- **Custom CSS**: Styled with custom CSS to ensure a clean and responsive layout for mobile devices.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool and development server for modern web projects.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Used to fetch real-time weather data.
- **CSS/Styled Components**: For designing and styling the app, including custom CSS for responsiveness.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **User Input**: The app provides an input field where the user can enter a city name.
2. **API Call**: Upon entering the city name, the app sends a request to the **OpenWeatherMap API** to fetch weather details for the entered city.
3. **Weather Display**: The weather information is dynamically displayed, including:
   - Temperature (in Celsius or Fahrenheit)
   - Humidity
   - Weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, etc.)
